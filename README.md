## Grading

All grading in this course will be through self-assessment on the Codekwondo learning platform.

### Cheating

Cheating in the class results in immediate failure of the course. What constitutes cheating? One example would be trying to deliver a duplicate of someone else's assignment, when it's not a group project. As a general rule though, if it feels dishonest, it's cheating.

### Not Trying

I really, *really* want each and every one of you to succeed. In fact, I'm more than happy to put in a lot of time outside of class giving you feedback and answering questions. In order to make this time though, I make less time for people that don't try.

If you don't actually want to learn web development, that's OK. I think you're making a mistake not learning one of the most valuable and high-paying skills in existence, but you can quit now. And you should quit.

This is a class that values proactivity by design. If you're hoping to cruise by unnoticed, just barely giving the instructor what they want, then this isn't the class for you.

To enforce this, **I have a 3 strikes rule.** These are the activities that could earn you a strike:

#### Missed deadlines

In a real job, your boss probably isn't going to dock your pay for not meeting a deadline. If you're going to miss a deadline though, I'd like to hear from you explaining why *beforehand*. Otherwise I'll worry and check in on you to make sure you're OK. I really want you to succeed. And I also want you to have a plan for how you'll prevent it in the future.

However, if you let deadlines pass without contacting me and without good reason, that's a strike. In a real job, you would get fired for this lack of professionalism. It's unacceptable to just not do work, hoping your boss doesn't notice.

#### Submitting incomplete work

Similarly, if you submit a project that *clearly* doesn't meet the criteria, that's a strike. I want to give you really great feedback, but if I keep having to hand out really obvious feedback, I won't have time for it.

#### Absences

We'll be doing a lot of our work online, but we'll also be doing a lot of work in class. Absences are a strike, explained or not. We only have 14 classes. If you miss 3 of them that's over 20%. What job are you allowed to not show up for 20% of the time?
